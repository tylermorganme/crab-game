## Your Directive

Break one or more of the design observations intentionally. The next viral game won't follow Wordle's playbook exactly — it'll violate expectations somewhere interesting.

Some rules worth breaking:
- "Anyone Can Play" — what if it requires a specific skill and that's what makes it special?
- "It's Cozy" — what if time pressure is the entire thrill?
- "Attempts Are Isolated" — what if your previous attempts change the game state?
- "No timer" — what if speed is the skill expression?
- "Purely mental" — what if dexterity is the point?
- "Everyone Gets the Same Puzzle" — what if asymmetry is the hook?

State which observation(s) you're breaking and WHY in your `meta.json` focus field. "Breaking X because Y" format. The game still needs to be fun, shareable, and make the player feel something worth sharing. You're not abandoning the philosophy — you're finding where it bends.
