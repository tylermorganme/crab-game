# Variant: Full Spirit

Include everything from `base.md` above, then add this directive:

## Your Directive

Embody the full spirit of the design philosophy. Your game should feel like it could sit alongside Wordle — simple, cozy, shareable, with hidden depth. Every design observation listed above should inform your choices, even if not every one maps directly to a mechanic. The overall *feeling* of playing should evoke the same satisfaction.

Specifically:
- Rules fit on a postcard
- Progressive narrowing makes it easier over attempts
- The share tells a story without spoiling
- The player feels clever
- Anyone can play — no dexterity, no niche knowledge
- Cozy pacing — no timers
- Clean, restrained UI

You have full creative freedom on the game concept. Invent something new. Don't clone Wordle.
