# Variant: Triple Focus

Include everything from `base.md` above, then add this directive:

## Your Directive

Pick THREE design observations from the philosophy above and build your game at their intersection. These three should create tension or synergy with each other — the interesting design space is where they overlap or conflict.

For example:
- "Seek vs Solve" + "You Can Fail" + "It's Cozy" — how do you make failure feel cozy while maintaining real stakes?
- "Anyone Can Play" + "Depth You Discover" + "The Share Tells a Story" — how do you hide depth that grandma and a speedrunner both appreciate?
- "Infinite to One" + "Entropy: Slots vs Options" + "Validation Forces Intentionality" — how do you make a collapsing possibility space where every move is deliberate?

State which three observations you chose in your `meta.json` focus field. Let the other principles fade — these three are your north star.
