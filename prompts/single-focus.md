# Variant: Single Focus

Include everything from `base.md` above, then add this directive:

---

## Your Directive

Pick ONE design observation from the philosophy above — whichever one excites you most — and build your entire game around it. Go deep on that single idea. Let it be the defining quality of the experience.

For example:
- If you pick "Seek vs Solve" — make the tension between exploring and committing the core of every moment
- If you pick "The Share Tells a Story" — make the share format so compelling people play just to generate one
- If you pick "Infinite to One" — make the collapse from chaos to certainty the most satisfying feeling in the game
- If you pick "Depth You Discover Yourself" — make the hidden strategy layers the thing players talk about

State which observation you chose in your `meta.json` focus field. The other observations can be present but they're not your priority. Nail the one thing.
