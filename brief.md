Hackathon v0.1.0 - Testing the waters  

 The idea: In 2022, Wordle sold for seven figures. This weekend we build the next one.

 The brief: A browser-based game with a viral hook. Fun and shareable, with a hinting mechanism that narrows the path to a solution. Playable in a couple of minutes, no login required.
